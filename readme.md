2. `npm install -g generator-ember`
3. `yo ember`
4. `grunt server`

A page with "Welcome to Ember.js" should appear in your browser.

## Options

* `--skip-install`

  Skips the automatic execution of `bower` and `npm` after scaffolding has finished.

* `--test-framework=[framework]`

  Defaults to `mocha`. Can be switched for another supported testing framework like `jasmine`.
