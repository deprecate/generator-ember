# Ember generator [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-ember.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-ember)

> Gets you started with a "Hello World" implementation of
[Ember](http://emberjs.com).

Maintainer: [Anthony Bull](https://github.com/inkredabull)


## Usage

First, if you have not installed yo yet via npm, do this:

- `npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower`

After installing yo, execute these steps one after another:

- `npm install -g generator-ember`
- `mkdir webapp && cd webapp`
- `yo ember`
- `grunt server --force`

A page with "Welcome to Ember.js" should appear in your browser.

## Options

* `--skip-install`

  Skips the automatic execution of `bower` and `npm` after scaffolding has finished.

* `--test-framework=[framework]`

  Defaults to `mocha`. Can be switched for another supported testing framework like `jasmine`.

* `--coffee`

  Enable support for CoffeeScript.


## Troubleshooting 

### `-bash: yo: command not found`

You need to make sure that npm is on your path.  Add the following to your .bash_profile (or .bashrc):

`PATH=/usr/local/share/npm/bin:$PATH`
